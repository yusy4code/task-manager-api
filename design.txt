This  will be my first own MERN stack app.

Objective is to have 

    - User Table (MongoDB)
    - Task Table
    - Register User
    - JWT token based authenticatino
    - hashing password while storing
    - Creating protected routes based on user logged in
    - Able to view task related to that particular user

Mongo Schema

users:
    _id
    name

    date

tasks:
    _id (for the task)
    userid (belongs to the user)
    taskName
    taskDescription
    taskStatus
